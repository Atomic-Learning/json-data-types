In a JSON file, there are several fundamental data types that you can use to represent different kinds of information.

<h2>Strings</h2>

Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in double quotes. They can include letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces. Strings may not be enclosed by single quotes. The following are all examples of valid JSON strings:

<ul>
    <li><code class="language-json">"Hello, World!"</code></li>
    <li><code class="language-json">"12345"</code></li>
    <li><code class="language-json">"JSON is fun!"</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>Numbers</h2>

Numbers in JSON can be integers or floating-point values. They are not enclosed in quotes. Examples of valid JSON numbers include:

<ul>
    <li><code class="language-json">42</code></li>
    <li><code class="language-json">3.14</code></li>
    <li><code class="language-json">-100</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>Booleans</h2>

Booleans represent truth values and can be either <code class="language-json">true</code> or <code class="language-json">false</code>. They are not enclosed in quotes, and must be all lower-case.

<h2>null</h2>

The <code class="language-json">null</code> value represents the absence of a value or a null value. It is not enclosed in quotes and is written in all lower-case.

<h2>Arrays and Objects</h2>

Arrays and objects are more complex data types that can hold multiple values. They will be covered in more detail on their respective pages.
